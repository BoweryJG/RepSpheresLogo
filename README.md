## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ 
- npm or yarn
- API keys for OpenRouter and Brave Search

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/BoweryJG/canvasheader.git
cd canvasheader
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

3. Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
# API Endpoints
VITE_API_ENDPOINT=your-api-endpoint
VITE_NPI_LOOKUP_ENDPOINT=your-npi-endpoint

# Supabase Configuration
VITE_SUPABASE_URL=your-supabase-url
VITE_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-supabase-anon-key

# Stripe Configuration  
VITE_STRIPE_PUBLISHABLE_KEY=your-stripe-key

# API Keys (if not using backend proxy)
VITE_OPENROUTER_API_KEY=your-openrouter-key
VITE_BRAVE_API_KEY=your-brave-key
```

4. Start the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
```

### Building for Production

```bash
npm run build
```

The build output will be in the `dist` directory.

## Usage

1. **Single Doctor Lookup**:
   - Start typing a doctor's name in the search bar
   - Select from NPI-verified results
   - Add any additional context (website, pain points, etc.)
   - Click "Generate Intel" for comprehensive research

2. **Batch Processing**:
   - Complete a single lookup first
   - Click "Scale This x10-2500" button
   - Select your power pack size
   - Upload CSV or manually enter doctor list
   - Process and download results

## Cost Structure

| Power Pack | Scans | Price | Per Scan |
|------------|-------|-------|----------|
| Starter | 10 | $45 | $4.50 |
| Growth | 25 | $100 | $4.00 |
| Professional | 50 | $175 | $3.50 |
| Team | 100 | $300 | $3.00 |
| Business | 250 | $625 | $2.50 |

| Scale | 1000 | $2,100 | $2.10 |
| Ultimate | 2500 | $4,975 | $1.99 |

## API Cost Optimization

Recent optimizations have significantly reduced API costs:

- **Before**: ~$1.58 per doctor lookup (duplicate API calls)
- **After**: ~$0.50-$0.80 per lookup
- **Savings**: 50-68% reduction in API costs

Key optimizations:
- Removed duplicate background research on doctor selection
- Added debouncing to prevent rapid selections
- Eliminated redundant fallback research in error handlers
- Consolidated API calls in unified research system

## Development
